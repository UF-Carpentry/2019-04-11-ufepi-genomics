  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

        The default shell in all versions of macOS is Bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access Bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).
        See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a>
        for an example on how to open the Terminal.

        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words. The default text editor on macOS and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive. If you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, hit
    the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key, followed by <kbd>:</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>+<kbd>!</kbd>
    (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark), then hitting <kbd>Return</kbd> to
    return to the shell.
